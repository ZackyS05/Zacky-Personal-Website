    <h2> Hello</h2>
        <p> Hello! my name is Zacky Sukasdadi. I am a teenager who is currently a Sophmore in Highschool. 
            I moved here from Singapore and I have lived in Colorado for 5 years. I love many things like the outdoors and I am an avid skier and biker. 
            I also love computers, videogames, and my favorite color is blue.</p>
