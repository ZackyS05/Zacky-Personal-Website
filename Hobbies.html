    <h1> Video Games</h1>
    <p>Video Games is one of my most favorite things in life. I would often play video games after school when I have no work, or when its the weekends. I usually play FPS and fighting type games. My favorite games that I have played is the Call Of Duty franchise, Minecraft, Destiny 2, Fortnite, and more. I would often play on my Xbox, but sometimes I would also play on my computer or VR headset. I have been playing video games since I was 4 years old and it is a big part of my life. </p>
